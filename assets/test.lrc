[00:00.00] Radical Face - Welcome Home, Son
[00:10.00] Sleep don't visit, so I choke on sun
[00:14.00] And the days blur into one
[00:18.00] And the backs of my eyes hum with things I've never done
[00:24.00] Sheets are swaying from an old clothesline
[00:28.00] Like a row of captured ghosts over old dead grass
[00:32.00] Was never much but we've made the most
[00:36.00] Welcome home
[00:40.00] Ships are launching from my chest
[00:44.00] Some have names but most do not
[00:48.00] If you find one, please let me know what piece I've lost
[00:54.00] Peel the scars from off my back
[00:58.00] I don't need them anymore
[01:02.00] You can throw them out or keep them in your mason jars
[01:08.00] I've come home
[01:12.00] All my nightmares escaped my head
[01:16.00] Bar the door, please don't let them in
[01:20.00] You were never supposed to leave
[01:24.00] Now my head's splitting at the seams
[01:28.00] And I don't know if I can
[01:32.00] Here, beneath my lungs, I feel your thumbs press into my skin again
[01:40.00] I have come home
[01:44.00] I have come home
[01:48.00] I have come home
[01:52.00] I have come home
