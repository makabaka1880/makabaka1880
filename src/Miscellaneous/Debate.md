# Debate
This note is completely based on a NSDA-styled debate course I took in 2022.

::: tip Public Forum
The debate style recognized by **National Speach & Debate Association(NSDA)**. Each team comprises of two debaters. The objective is to convince the judge why your side of the debate is better than your opponentsâ€™. The topics, or resolutions as they are called, are issued every month of the season by NSDA (September to June). You are mandated to prepare both the pro/affirmative, and the con/negative as you will only know which side your team will debate moments before the round begins.
