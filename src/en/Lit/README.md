> Why would I open up this section?

I was cleaning my disk the other day

When i can't help but notice the HUGE amount of data in my School2024 folder

There's notes from the love story of Romeo and Juliet to the post-modernistic Ender's Game...

They are valuable resources, so I've decided to archive them up here, and to help others in need.
