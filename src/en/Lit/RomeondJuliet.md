## Prologue/Act 1, Scene 1

### 1. **In which town is the play set? In what country do you suppose this town exists?**
- The play is set in **Verona**, a real city in **Italy**.

### 2. **In the prologue, Shakespeare tells us that our two title characters are going to kill themselves. How could this knowledge improve the play?**
- Knowing that Romeo and Juliet will die creates dramatic irony, where the audience is aware of the impending tragedy while the characters are not. This awareness deepens the emotional impact and intensifies the audience's engagement, as they watch how the characters' actions unknowingly lead them to their fate.

### 3. **When Sampson says he will not “carry coals,” what does he mean? What literary technique is being used?**
- Sampson means he won’t endure insults or humiliation ("carry coals" was a phrase meaning to suffer disgrace). The exchange with Gregory uses **pun** as a literary technique, playing on the multiple meanings of words.

### 4. **Is Benvolio a Montague or a Capulet?**
- Benvolio is a **Montague**.

### 5. **Why doesn’t Lady Capulet want her husband to get involved in the fight?**
- Lady Capulet holds her husband back because he is too old to be fighting and likely would get hurt or make a fool of himself.

### 6. **How many times have the Capulets and Montagues had street fights recently?**
- The Capulets and Montagues have fought **three times** recently.

### 7. **How has Romeo been spending his days recently?**
- Romeo has been locking himself away in his room, brooding and feeling moody because he is lovesick over Rosaline.

### 8. **List three of the oxymorons Romeo uses to describe the conflict between his family and the Capulets. How is the family feud oxymoronic?**
- Oxymorons used by Romeo include:
  1. **"O brawling love, O loving hate!"**
  2. **"Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health!"**
  3. **"Still-waking sleep."**
- The family feud is oxymoronic because it involves intense hatred between families who are similar in status and have no substantial reason for their enmity, reflecting the contradictory nature of their conflict.

### 9. **In your own words, rewrite Romeo’s speech about love in Scene 1, lines 176-180, line by line:**
- **Original Lines:**
  1. "Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?"
  2. "Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all."
  3. "Here’s much to do with hate, but more with love."
  4. "Why then, O brawling love! O loving hate! O anything, of nothing first created!""
- **Rewritten:**
  1. Where should I go to eat? Oh no! What fight happened here?
  2. But don’t tell me, I’ve already heard everything.
  3. This has a lot to do with hate, but even more with love.
  4. Why is love so full of conflict? Why is hate so close to love? Everything comes out of nothing at all!
  5. 
### 10. **Name three of the ineffective romantic strategies Romeo has used to woo this girl.**
- Romeo has:
  1. **Gazed at her longingly.**
  2. **Sent her loving looks and sighs.**
  3. **Expressed his love with poetry and flattery.**

### 11. **Why doesn’t this girl like Romeo?**
- The girl, Rosaline, doesn’t like Romeo because she has sworn to live a life of chastity and isn’t interested in romantic relationships.

### 12. **What does Benvolio tell Romeo to do in order to forget the girl who doesn’t want him?**
- Benvolio advises Romeo to **look at other women** and compare them to Rosaline, believing this will help him forget her.

## Act 1, Scene 2

### 1. **What “suit” does Paris bring to Capulet in Scene 2?**
- Paris brings a **request to marry Juliet** to Capulet.

### 2. **How old is Juliet? What are her father’s thoughts about allowing her to marry?**
- Juliet is **13 years old**. Her father thinks she is too young to marry and suggests waiting two more years, although he is not entirely opposed to Paris courting her.

### 3. **Why, do you suppose, Capulet is willing to take Juliet’s feelings into consideration?**
- Capulet cares deeply for Juliet and wants her to be happy, which is why he values her opinion. He also likely recognizes that a loving and willing marriage partner will lead to a more successful and harmonious union.

### 4. **Why is the Capulet servant upset about having been given a list of party guests to find?**
- The servant is upset because he **cannot read** the list of names, making it impossible for him to find the guests.

### 5. **Why does Benvolio want to crash the party? Why does Romeo agree?**
- Benvolio wants to crash the party to help Romeo **see other beautiful women** and forget Rosaline. Romeo agrees because he hopes to **see Rosaline** at the party.

### 6. **What does Romeo want to happen to his eyes if they find someone other than Rosaline desirable at the party? What does this show us about Romeo?**
- Romeo says that if he finds anyone else desirable, his **tears should turn to fire and burn out his eyes**. This shows that Romeo is dramatic and deeply committed to his current feelings, even though they may change quickly.

## Act 1, Scene 3

### 1. **In your own words, explain the Nurse’s two stories about Juliet as a toddler.**
- The Nurse tells two stories:
  1. **Juliet's fall**: When Juliet was a toddler, she fell and hurt her forehead. The Nurse’s husband joked that when Juliet was older, she would fall backward (referring to losing her virginity), to which Juliet replied, "Yes."
  2. **Weaning Juliet**: The Nurse recalls when she was weaning Juliet, who was reluctant to stop breastfeeding. The Nurse applied a bitter substance to her breast, and Juliet was so upset that she eventually gave up nursing.

### 2. **Explain Lady Capulet’s opinion about Paris.**
- Lady Capulet thinks Paris is a perfect match for Juliet. She describes him as handsome and worthy, comparing him to a beautiful book that Juliet would only enhance by being his wife.

### 3. **What is Juliet’s reaction to her mother’s request? What does this show us about Juliet?**
- Juliet is obedient and respectful. She agrees to observe Paris at the party but does not promise to love him. This shows Juliet’s practicality and willingness to comply with her parents' wishes, yet it also hints at her independent thinking.

## Act 1, Scene 4

### 1. **According to Mercutio, who or what is Queen Mab, and what does she do?**
- Queen Mab is a **fairy** who visits people in their dreams, bringing them visions of what they most desire. For example, she causes lovers to dream of love, soldiers to dream of battles, and lawyers to dream of fees.

### 2. **What does Romeo say about the value of dreams?**
- Romeo believes that **dreams hold significant meaning** and reflect reality or predict future events, especially as they relate to his own experiences.

### 3. **What does Mercutio say about the value of dreams?**
- Mercutio dismisses dreams as **meaningless fantasies**, suggesting that they are just the product of an idle brain and have no real substance.

### 4. **At the end of Scene 4, Romeo mentions the subject of his latest vivid dream. What did Romeo dream? Why isn’t he changing his course of action? What does this show us about Romeo?**
- Romeo dreamt that something bad would happen if he went to the Capulet party, leading to his untimely death. Despite this, he doesn’t change his course of action because he believes in **fate** and thinks whatever happens is beyond his control. This shows that Romeo is fatalistic and willing to accept whatever destiny has in store for him.

## Act 1, Scene 5

### 1. **When Romeo first sees Juliet, what terms does he use to describe her?**
- Romeo describes Juliet as a **"rich jewel in an Ethiope's ear"** and **"a snowy dove trooping with crows"**, emphasizing her beauty and brightness compared to everything else around her.

### 2. **How does Tybalt recognize Romeo?**
- Tybalt recognizes Romeo by his **voice** when he overhears him speaking.

### 3. **When Tybalt is ready to seize Romeo and throw him out of the party, what does Capulet say to Tybalt? Why? What is Tybalt’s reaction to this?**
- Capulet tells Tybalt to leave Romeo alone because he has heard that Romeo is a virtuous and well-behaved young man, and he doesn’t want any trouble at the party. Tybalt is **angry and feels insulted** by this, but he reluctantly agrees to obey his

 uncle.

### 4. **How does Romeo find out Juliet’s last name?**
- Romeo learns Juliet’s last name when he asks the **Nurse** who her mother is, and she tells him that Juliet is the daughter of Lady Capulet.

### 5. **How does Juliet find out Romeo’s last name?**
- Juliet learns Romeo’s last name by asking the **Nurse** to identify several guests and eventually Romeo, discovering that he is a Montague.

### 6. **Explain how the costumes in the 1996 film version are appropriate for each character.**
- In the 1996 film:
  - **Juliet is dressed as an angel**, symbolizing her innocence, purity, and divine love.
  - **Romeo is dressed as a knight**, representing his role as a romantic hero and protector.
  - **Paris is dressed as an astronaut**, symbolizing his detachment and otherworldliness, as well as his desire to explore (in this case, a marriage with Juliet) without understanding the emotional depths involved.

## Act 2, Scene 1

### 1. **What does the Act 2 Prologue say happened to Romeo’s love for Rosaline? How is this an example of foreshadowing?**
- The Prologue says that Romeo’s love for Rosaline is **dead** and has been replaced by a new love for Juliet. This foreshadows the intense and tragic nature of Romeo’s love for Juliet, suggesting that it will be far more significant than his previous infatuation.

### 2. **What does Romeo mean by “dull earth” in Scene 1, line 2?**
- Romeo refers to his own body as “dull earth,” meaning it is lifeless and empty without Juliet, who he views as his soul and life force.

### 3. **Who does Mercutio think that Romeo is in love with in his speech in Scene 1, lines 6-21? What’s funny about these lines?**
- Mercutio thinks that Romeo is still in love with **Rosaline**. The humor comes from the fact that Mercutio is mocking Romeo’s infatuation, not knowing that Romeo has already moved on to Juliet.

## Act 2, Scene 2

### 1. **When Romeo says, “He jests at scars that never felt a wound,” what does he mean?**
- Romeo means that Mercutio makes fun of love because he has never experienced its deep pain or intensity.

### 2. **What does Romeo compare Juliet to in his first speech in Sc. 2, lines 2-3?**
- Romeo compares Juliet to the **sun**, calling her the light that brightens his world and outshines everything else.

### 3. **In your own words, rewrite Juliet’s speech in Scene 2, lines 33-36.**
- **Original:**
  1. "O Romeo, Romeo! Wherefore art thou Romeo?"
  2. "Deny thy father and refuse thy name;"
  3. "Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,"
  4. "And I’ll no longer be a Capulet."
   
- **Rewritten:**
  1. "Oh Romeo, why do you have to be Romeo?"
  2. "Reject your family name and all it stands for."
  3. "Or if you won’t do that, just promise to love me,"
  4. "And I’ll stop being a Capulet."

### 4. **When Juliet says “That which we call a rose / By any other word would smell as sweet,” what does she mean? Do names matter in our lives?**
- Juliet means that names are arbitrary and do not change the essence of a thing; Romeo would still be the same person even if he weren’t called “Montague.” Names can influence how we are perceived and how we perceive ourselves, but they do not define our core being. If you had a different name, your identity might have developed differently due to how others responded to that name.

### 5. **In your own words, translate Juliet’s meaning in lines 95-101. Why do other young lovers, both then and now, play such games?**
- **Original:**
  - "Thou know’st the mask of night is on my face,"
  - "Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek"
  - "For that which thou hast heard me speak tonight."
  - "Fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny"
  - "What I have spoke. But farewell compliment."
  - "Dost thou love me?"
   
- **Rewritten:**
  - "You can’t see my face clearly because it’s dark,"
  - "Otherwise, you’d see me blushing from what I’ve said."
  - "I’d like to pretend I didn’t say it and take it back,"
  - "But I won’t play games. Do you love me?"
   
- Young lovers often play such games to protect their feelings and avoid appearing too eager or vulnerable, both then and now.

### 6. **Why does Juliet ask Romeo not to swear his love’s allegiance by the moon?**
- Juliet asks Romeo not to swear by the moon because the moon is **inconstant** and changes its shape every night. She wants his love to be steadfast and unchanging.

### 7. **Which one is the first to mention marriage? What does this show us about this character?**
- **Juliet** is the first to mention marriage, showing that she is serious about their relationship and is thinking practically about the future.

### 8. **What does Juliet instruct Romeo to send her the next day?**
- Juliet asks Romeo to send her **word of when and where they will be married**.

### 9. **Look at lines 182-184. What do these lines literally mean? How is this text an example of foreshadowing?**
- **Literal Meaning:**
  - Romeo wants to be around Juliet all the time like the parrot on the pirate’s shoulder. 
  - Juliet is scared that she is going to kill Romeo with all the love that she will give to him.
- This explains foreshadowing because Juliet is confusing her love for Romeo and Romeo is confusing his love for Juliet but they both know that their family isn't fond of their love for each other.

- Friar Laurence is **gathering herbs and flowers** in the early morning.

- The Friar assumes Romeo has spent the night with **Rosaline**.

### 4. **In lines 87-88, the Friar says, “O, she knew well / Thy love did read by rote and could not spell.” Explain what he means.**

### 5. **Why does the Friar begrudgingly agree to marry Romeo and Juliet?**
- The Friar agrees to marry them because he hopes that their union will **end the feud** between the Montagues and Capulets, bringing peace to Verona.

## Act 2, Scene 4

### 1. **Who are Laura, Dido, Cleopatra, Helen, and Hero? What does Mercutio say about them?**
- **Laura**: A legendary poet’s muse (Petrarch’s muse).

- **Cleopatra**: The famous Queen of Egypt.
- **Helen**: Helen of Troy, whose beauty sparked the Trojan War.
- **Hero**: A character in Greek mythology, known from the story of Hero and Leander.

## Act 2, Scene 6

### 1. **Is Romeo fearful of the future? Write down the lines that support your answer.**
- No, Romeo is not fearful of the future. He says: "Then love-devouring death do what he dare; / It is enough I may but call her mine."

### 2. **In your own words, explain the Friar’s warning in these lines: “These violent delights have violent ends And in their triumph die like fire and powder, Which, as they kiss, consume.”**
- The Friar warns that intense passions often lead to disastrous outcomes, like when fire ignites gunpowder, resulting in a destructive explosion.

### 3. **In your own words, explain the Friar’s message in these lines: “Therefore love moderately; long love doth so: Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow.”**
- The Friar advises Romeo to love steadily and not rush into things because love that is too intense or too slow can be just as harmful as love that doesn’t move at all.

## Act 3, Scene 1

### 1. **At the beginning of Act 3, who says the following lines? What do these lines foreshadow? “I pray thee, good Mercutio, let’s retire. The day is hot, the Capulets abroad, And, if we meet, we shall not ‘scape a brawl, For now, these hot days, is the mad blood stirring.”**

### 2. **What does Mercutio tell us about Benvolio in lines 15-27? Is this true? Explain what’s happening here.**
- Mercutio claims that Benvolio is quick to quarrel, picking fights over trivial matters. This isn’t true; Mercutio is being ironic, as Benvolio is usually the peacekeeper.

### 3. **Examine Mercutio’s “grave man” line. What figure of speech is used? What is the meaning?**
- Mercutio uses a **pun** when he says "grave man," referring both to being serious and to his impending death.

### 4. **Explain the following lines (104-110): “This gentleman, the Prince’s near ally, My very friend, hath got his mortal hurt In my behalf – my reputation stained With Tybalt’s slander – Tybalt, that an hour Hath been my cousin. O sweet Juliet, Thy beauty hath made me effeminate And in my temper soft’ned valor’s steel!”**
- Romeo laments that his love for Juliet has made him weak and less manly, which he believes has caused Mercutio’s death. He feels guilty because he didn’t act aggressively against Tybalt earlier.

### 5. **Explain the Prince’s judgment and why he makes this ruling.**

## Act 3, Scene 5

- Juliet wants to believe it’s a nightingale because nightingales sing at night. If it’s

 still night, Romeo doesn’t have to leave yet. A lark sings in the morning, meaning it’s dawn and Romeo must go.

### 2. **What does Juliet mean by an “ill-divining soul” in Scene 5, line 54?**
- Juliet means that she has a foreboding feeling, a premonition of something bad happening, which turns out to be accurate since this is the last time she sees Romeo alive.

- Juliet wakes up **just after** Romeo dies.
