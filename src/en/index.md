::: tip Notice
My father passed away on 2024/12/20. We have not yet performed autopsy so the exact cause of death is not yet known, but likely mechanical asphyxia because of choking. He was only 52 years old, but his life was forever paused on that fateful day. However, his love and memories will never fade away.

Just the day before his death, he recieve the news of his son's pre-admission notice from Shanghai Starriverbay Bilingual. At least in that moment, he was happy, and I will carry that joy and his expectations as I move forward.

We have just retrieved his phone from the police. As we looked through his expensive, not one of those exceeded 50 RMB, except for our pocket money and registration fees. Throughout his life, as a father and the pillar of our family, he gave his love so fully.

To show tribute to my father, this website will temporarily put on a 100% grayscale css filter. Thank you for your understanding and support.

May love and memory live on.
