**Hello, who ever stumbled on this blog:wave:～**

I'm just a middle school student from CN, Shanghai

These are all sorts of weird stuff and notes I've written learning all sorts of weird stuff :)

Always a headache to organize these, and I've recently wanted a blog so I just dumped them all on here
