## Original Draft

Everyone has a dream, and mine is to become an excellent dentist. I hope to live in a peceful place where I can enjoy peaceful moments. In my free time, I want to go to the seaside sit by the ocean, and read books. But more importantly, I want to use my skills to help people. My interest in dentistry started because of my own experiences. When I was a child, I loved eating sweets. which led to serious dental problems. I had to visit the dentist many times and spent a lot d money on treatment.
However, some of the dentists I visited were not skilled and instead of fixing my teeth, they made my pain worser. I realized that many people in society might have similar experiences. Some may suffer from bad dental care, while others may not be able to afford it.
Another reason I want to be an dentist is that I want to help people in need. Good teeth are very important for people's health. My grandma has serious dental problems, and then after spending a lot of money on treatments, her condition didn't improve. Because of her bad teeth, she can't eat many foods, which affects her nutrition and health. This made me realize how important it is to have access to good dental care. In the future, I want to do volunteer work in poor areas if I have opportunity, helping people who can't afford proper treatment. To achieve my dream,
I'll study hard and gain the skills needed to become a great dentist.
Maybe someday. I can make a real difference in people's lives and see their smile with confidence.
Finally, I want to say "Be the change that you wish to see in the world."

## Paragraph 1 - Intro
### Breakdown

> Everyone has a dream, and mine is to become an excellent dentist.

---

> I hope to live in a peceful place where I can enjoy peaceful moments.

**CRITICAL - SP** Peceful -> Peaceful

**Diction** Repetition of `peace` sounds boring. 
*Consider sth like*
- I hope to live in a peaceful world where I can enjoy serene moments.

---

> In my free time, I want to go to the seaside, sit by the ocean, and read books.

**Parallelism** 
- go to the seaside: main verb + aux verb + article + obj
- sit by the ocean: main verb + aux verb + article + obj
- read books: main verb + obj
*Consider sth like*
In my free time, I want to go to the seaside, sit by the ocean, and ==read (books) by the shore==.

---

> But more importantly, I want to use my skills to help people. 

---

Theme isn’t prominent; consider restructuring/adding things?

## Paragraph 2 - Statement
### Breakdown

> My interest in dentistry started because of my own experiences.

**Diction** started because of -> emerged from
*Ignore this suggestion if going for a concise/simple tone*

---

> When I was a child, I loved eating sweets, which led to serious dental problems.

**Ambiguous Reference** which led to is not specific enough
*Consider sth like*
When I was a child, I loved eating sweets ==. This habit== led to some serious dental problems.

---

> I had to visit the dentist many times and spent a lot of money on treatment.

**Tense**
- Visit: simple past
- Spent: past perfect
Grammatically correct but incoherent in parallel
*Consider sth like*
I had to visit the dentist repeatedly and spend a lot of money.

**Structure** Consider combining it with your last sentence.
When I was a child, I loved eating sweets ==. This led to some serious dental problems==, requiring frequent visits to the dentist and significant expenses.

---

> However, some of the dentists I visited were not skilled and instead of fixing my teeth, they made my pain worser.

**CRITICAL - Form** worser -> worse

**Structure** The command separated the sentence in an awkward place. 
*Consider sth like*
However, some of the dentists I visited were not ==skilled. Instead== of alleviating my pain, they made it worse.

---

> I realized that many people in society might have similar experiences. Some may suffer from bad dental care, while others may not be able to afford it.

**Ambiguous Reference** `in society`  sounds a bit empty. `Some` isn’t referencing correctly
*Consider sth like*
I realized that many people in our society might face ==similar challenges — some struggle with poor dental care, while others simply cannot afford it.==

---

### Result

> My interest in dentistry emerged from my own experiences. When I was a child, I loved eating sweets. When I was a child, I loved eating sweets. This led to some serious dental problems, requiring frequent visits to the dentist and significant expenses. However, some of the dentists I visited lacked skill; instead of alleviating my pain, they made it worse.

Pretty nice

## Paragraph 3 - Statement
### Breakdown

> Another reason I want to be an dentist is that I want to help people in need.

**CRITICAL - Articles** an dentist -> a dentist

**Tone** Use more academic phrasing
*Consider sth like*
Another reason I want to be ==a dentist== is that I want to help ==those== in need.

---

> Good teeth are very important for people's health. 

**Tone** Use more academic phrasing then `Good teeth`
*Consider sth like*
==Health teeth== are very important for ==one’s wellbeing==.

---

> My grandma has serious dental problems, and then after spending a lot of money on treatments, her condition didn't improve.

**CRITICAL - Run-on**
- My grandma has serious dental problems: Independent clause
- After spending a lot of money on treatments, her condition didn't improve: Also an independent clause

**Delivery**
Try to keep the focus on the expense without making health sound like a direct transaction.
*Consider sth like*
My grandma suffered from serious dental problems. ==Despite all the treatments she went through, her condition remained unchanged==.

---

> Because of her bad teeth, she can't eat many foods, which affects her nutrition and health. 

**Tone** `Bad teeth` is informal, which is inconsistent with an academic essay and the overall tone.
*Consider sth like*
Due to her condition, she struggles to eat a variety of food, which negatively impacts her nutrition and overall well-being.

---

> This made me realize how important it is to have access to good dental care. 

**Delivery** Maybe try to replace `this` with a better reference, bringing the essay together

*Consider sth like*
==Witnessing my grandma’s pain==, I began to realize how crucial it is for everyone to have access to proper dental care.

---

> In the future, I want to do volunteer work in poor areas if I have opportunity, helping people who can't afford proper treatment.

**CRUCIAL - Article** Opportunity -> the opportunity

**Structure** Maybe omit `have the opportunity` altogether for conciseness

**Organization** move to a seperate conclusion paragraph?
*Consider sth like*
In the future, I would like to participate in ==non-profit medical initiatives in underserved areas==, helping ==those== who can't afford proper treatment.

---

> To achieve my dream, I'll study hard and gain the skills needed to become a great dentist.

**Organization** If not explicitly stated in the succ. crit., this sentence isn’t necessary. I’d recommend deleting it or elaborating on this sentence.

---

> Maybe someday, I can make a real difference in people's lives and see their smile with confidence.

**CRUCIAL - Form**
- *If `smile` is a verb:* … see them smile with confidence.
- *If `smile` is a noun*: … see their confident smile.
- Or change the sentence organization altogether

**Organization** move to a seperate conclusion paragraph?

*Consider sth like*
Someday, I will make a real difference in people's lives and ==help them regain the confidence to smile==.

---

> Finally, I want to say "Be the change that you wish to see in the world.”

**Organization** Move to a separate conclusion paragraph?

---

### Result

> Another reason I want to be a dentist is that I want to help those in need. My grandma suffered from serious dental problems.
